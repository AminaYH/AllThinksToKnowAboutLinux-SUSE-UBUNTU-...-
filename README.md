ðŸš¨ Alert: This repository will contain everything you need to know when starting to use a Linux system.

I'll begin with openSUSE Tumbleweed, then move on to Leap.
You'll find documents and files filled with tips and advice to help you confidently begin using Linux and eventually master it.

Every day, Iâ€™ll add a new tip or insight to make your transition to Linux smoother â€” so you wonâ€™t be afraid of switching.
Over time, you'll start to see Linux not as something difficult, but as a powerful system that puts you in control.
