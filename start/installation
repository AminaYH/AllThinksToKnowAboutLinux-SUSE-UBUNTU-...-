🐧 Linux Distros 
To download openSUSE or any Linux distribution, you can just Google a tutorial — there are plenty out there.

But so you don’t get lost between them, I’ll guide you through it.

🧠 Some Concepts First
What is a distro?
Linux is a general term for operating systems built around something called the kernel.

What is the kernel?
The kernel is the core of the operating system.

To go back in history:
We have Unix, created in the 1970s — it was the first system to bring multitasking and other advanced features.

Originally, everything was based on Unix — even Windows (they don’t say it on their website, but technically it shares Unix ideas; they just developed it differently for user usage).
And of course, macOS is also based on Unix.

So let’s go back to the kernel.

The kernel is like the brain of the computer.
It connects hardware and software.

In another part, I’ll explain more about the kernel, Linux domains, VMs, and folders — those need a full section.

🐧 Installing a Distro
🐧 Installing a Distro – Without the Confusion
Now let’s talk about how to actually install a distro.

Don’t be intimidated by the large number of distributions. Let’s say it from the beginning: all distros are built on the same Linux kernel, so at the core, they’re the same.
The big differences lie in the pre-installed packages, the package manager, and sometimes performance or target audience.

We already talked about the kernel, right?
All distros are Linux, and Linux is a Unix-like system — that’s the official term. But to simplify it: Linux is packaged into what's called a "Linux distribution" (or "distro").

In this demo, I’ll walk you through installing openSUSE.

📁 Step 1: Understand the File System
Before installation, it helps to understand the file system.
There are several types, but the most popular ones are Btrfs and EXT4.

I personally use EXT4 because I don’t use Snapper (a tool for managing system snapshots, which Btrfs supports).

But if you're new to Linux, I recommend trying Btrfs. Why? Because you’re likely to make a few mistakes early on — Btrfs with Snapper lets you roll back to a previous snapshot in seconds. It can literally save your system.

💾 Step 2: What is Swap?
Swap is like an extension of your RAM.
If you have 8 GB of RAM, you can add 4–8 GB of swap to help manage memory more smoothly.

Swap is great for laptops, but if you’re installing openSUSE or another distro on a VM, swap can have some downsides — I’ll talk more about that later when we cover virtualization (like PVs and HVMs).

🧱 Step 3: Disk Partitioning
Your file system is usually divided into three main partitions:

/home – where your personal files are stored

/ (root) – where system files, core packages, and the OS itself live

swap – as we mentioned, used as virtual memory

That’s it — no C:, D:, E:, or F: drives like in Windows. This is called partitioning.

⚠️ Installing Linux Alongside Windows
If you want to dual boot Linux and Windows, that’s a different setup.

I personally didn’t do dual boot — I use only openSUSE.
But if you want to keep Windows, you must partition your disk beforehand. Here's a good tutorial that explains the steps and covers UEFI:

⚠️ Important: You need to disable BitLocker before installing Linux alongside Windows.
BitLocker encrypts your disk — so Linux won’t be able to access the drive properly unless it's turned off.

🌱 openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed?
You’ll be asked whether to install Leap or Tumbleweed.

I’ve used both, and I’m currently using Leap.

Leap is more stable — perfect for development or everyday use.

Tumbleweed is a rolling release — always updating with the newest packages. Great for learning or experimenting, but can be unstable sometimes.

My advice: try one, get used to it, and you can always switch later.

🖥️ Linux on Different PCs
I use an HP laptop, not a gaming machine.
But from helping others, I’ve seen that some gaming laptops (like ASUS TUF or similar) might face minor issues when installing Linux.
Nothing serious — usually just small driver or compatibility tweaks
