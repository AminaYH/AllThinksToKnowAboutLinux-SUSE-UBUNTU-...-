‚ö†Ô∏è First things first: Always backup your system!
Before doing anything serious with your SUSE system‚Äî package installation,... ‚Äîmake sure to backup your important files or codes. This cannot be stressed enough.

Use:

Git for code or text file versioning

Google Drive, Dropbox, or any cloud storage for documents

External drives or network storage for larger or sensitive data

This is your safety net if anything goes wrong.

üîÑ Never shutdown after updating ‚Äî always reboot via terminal
One of the most important things to remember when using openSUSE, especially Tumbleweed (a rolling release), is:

‚ö†Ô∏è Never shut down the system immediately after an update. Always use sudo reboot.

Why?

After using zypper install or zypper dup (distribution upgrade), the system will often recommend a reboot.

Shutting down the system without rebooting can corrupt your system, especially if critical packages, services, or kernel updates were applied.

openSUSE Tumbleweed updates very frequently, which increases the risk of this issue.

üß† Understanding Why This Happens
There are several technical reasons:

Reboot (not shutdown) finalizes updates:

When you use sudo reboot, the system gracefully restarts all services and processes.

Some update-related operations are written to cache or kept in memory and only applied properly during a clean reboot.

sudo reboot ensures persistence, which means the new kernel and services are fully loaded.

Shutdown skips critical steps:

A regular shutdown can stop the system before all updates are committed properly.

This may leave your system in an inconsistent state, especially if system-critical components like the kernel, systemd, or network services were updated.

zypper needs-rebooting is helpful ‚Äî but not always accurate:

It tries to tell you if a reboot is required.

However, it's not 100% reliable ‚Äî it can miss some cases.

So, after large upgrades, it's safer to always do:

bash
Copier
Modifier
sudo reboot
